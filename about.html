	<p><h3>The story of the Brooklyn-based band Near Peak starts back in an elementary school day care just over 20 years ago in the San Francisco Bay Area. Travis and Alex met while tinkering on broken electronics given to them as a distraction. Taking stuff apart and figuring out how they worked came pretty naturally.</h3></p>
	<p><h3>Fast forward a decade, everyone in the band, Josh, Travis, and Alex, all tackled the music program at UC Santa Cruz. They all continued their passion of taking stuff apart and figuring out how it worked, this time via music.</h3></p>
	<p><h3>Fast forward another decade, everyone found their way through an uncountable number of musical projects, and also found themselves in Brooklyn. Travis and Alex knew that a band had to come together, and when they were introduced to Josh, everyone realized that it was a perfect combination. Music was made.</h3></p>
